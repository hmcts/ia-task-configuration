# Work Allocation System - IA Task Configuration

## Overview

The Work Allocation system is an automated task assignment platform that replaces email-based task management for internal users. It integrates with CCD (Case and Case Data) to automatically create, assign, and manage tasks based on configurable business rules.

## Purpose

- **Eliminates email communications** for case progress notifications
- **Automates task assignment** from shared inboxes
- **Categorizes tasks** by type (review appeals, listing cases, judge assignment)
- **Provides role-based assignment** to appropriate user types (legal officers, admin staff, CTSC staff)

## System Architecture

### Message Flow
1. **CCD Event triggered** → Message sent to CCD queue
2. **Work Allocation subscribes** to messages based on publish flags
3. **Tasks created** according to DMN (Decision Model and Notation) rules
4. **XUI displays** tasks to users

### Key Components

#### User Interface
The system provides two main tabs:

- **My Work**: Tasks assigned to or available for the current user
- **All Work**: Overview for supervisors/managers to see all tasks and assign them

#### Filtering Options
- **My Work filters**: Location, work type, role category
- **All Work filters**: Additional task name filter
- **Predefined filters**: Cannot be customized without XUI changes

## Technical Configuration

### DMN Files Structure

The system uses six main DMN (Decision Model and Notation) files:

#### 1. Task Initiation DMN
- Defines **when** tasks are created
- Based on CCD events and conditions
- Uses case data fields for business rules
- Supports delay mechanisms for follow-up tasks

#### 2. Configuration DMN
- Defines task attributes (work type, role category)
- Configures shortcuts to events
- Sets up due date calculations
- Manages priority settings
- Controls UI columns and filters

#### 3. Permissions DMN
- Controls user access to tasks
- Defines task-level permissions (assign, cancel, complete)
- Implements role-based access control

#### 4. Task Types DMN
- Lists all task types for filtering in UI
- Must match task names defined in initiation file

#### 5. Task Completion DMN
- Defines auto-completion rules
- Automatically closes tasks when events progress

#### 6. Cancellation DMN
- Cancels follow-up tasks when actions complete early
- Uses process categories for bulk cancellation

### CCD Integration

#### Publish Flags
- Control message sending at both event and field level
- Must be set to `Y` for events and fields that should trigger work allocation
- Case data fields used in DMN rules must have publish flags enabled

#### Task Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: Based on event triggers and configured conditions
2. **Assignment**: Manual or automatic based on permissions
3. **Completion**: Manual by users or automatic based on event progression
4. **Cancellation**: Automatic for outdated follow-up tasks

## Building and Deploying the Application

### Building the application

The project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org) as a build tool. It already contains
`./gradlew` wrapper script, so there's no need to install gradle.

To build the project execute the following command:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

### Running the application

Create the image of the application by executing the following command:

```bash
./gradlew assemble
```

Create docker image:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

Run the distribution by executing the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start the API container exposing the application's port
(set to `4550` in this template app).

In order to test if the application is up, you can call its health endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4550/health
```

### Alternative script to run application

To skip all the setting up and building, just execute the following command:

```bash
./bin/run-in-docker.sh
```

For more information:

```bash
./bin/run-in-docker.sh -h
```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

To add new tasks or modify existing ones:

1. **Update Task Initiation DMN** - Add rules for when tasks should be created
2. **Configure attributes in Configuration DMN** - Set filters, shortcuts, due dates
3. **Set permissions in Permissions DMN** - Define who can access the tasks
4. **Add task type to Task Types DMN** - Enable filtering in UI
5. **Configure completion rules** (if needed) - Set auto-completion conditions
6. **Update unit tests** - Ensure test coverage for new rules

### Repository Structure
- **Task Configuration Repo**: Contains all DMN files
- **IA Case API**: Consumes DMN files via automated scripts
- **Branch selection**: Configurable for DMN loading

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Each DMN file has dedicated unit tests
- Tests validate rule logic using input/output mocks
- Tests are maintained and should be updated with rule changes

### Functional Tests
- **Current status**: Outdated and failing
- **Recommendation**: Write new isolated tests for current work
- **Strategy**: Avoid dependency on legacy test suite

### Manual Testing
- **Preview Environment**: Primary platform for testing changes
- **Camunda Cockpit**: Available at `/camunda` path for manual DMN deployment
- **Local Environment**: Supported but requires message queue configuration

## Environment Setup

### Preview Environment
- Preferred for integration testing
- Manual DMN upload via Camunda UI using admin credentials
- Configuration details available in repository README

### Local Development
- Full support available
- Requires Azure Service Bus message queue setup
- Environment configuration needed for CCD integration

## DMN Deployment Scripts

### Automated DMN Upload to Preview Environment

The repository includes an automated script to upload Work Allocation DMN files to the preview environment, eliminating the need for manual UI uploads and reducing deployment time.

#### Script: `bin/upload-wa-dmn-preview.sh`

**Purpose**: Automates the upload of all Work Allocation DMN files to Camunda in preview environments.

**Key Features**:
- Uploads multiple DMN files in a single execution
- Comprehensive error handling with clear error messages
- Success confirmation for each uploaded file
- Dry-run mode for testing without actual uploads

**Usage**:
```bash
# Basic usage - upload to PR 2609 preview environment
./bin/upload-wa-dmn-preview.sh -p 2609

# Dry run to see what would be uploaded
./bin/upload-wa-dmn-preview.sh -p 2609 --dry-run

# View help and all options
./bin/upload-wa-dmn-preview.sh --help
```

**Parameters**:
- `-p, --pr PR_NUMBER` (required): PR number for preview environment
- `-d, --dry-run`: Show what would be done without uploading
- `-w, --workspace PATH`: Workspace path (default: current directory)
- `-t, --tenant-id ID`: Tenant ID (default: ia)
- `-h, --help`: Show help message

**Prerequisites**:
- Access to the preview environment Camunda instance, VPN is ON

**DMN Files Uploaded**:
The script automatically discovers and uploads all `.dmn` files from `src/main/resources/`:
- `wa-task-allowed-days-ia-asylum.dmn`
- `wa-task-cancellation-ia-asylum.dmn`
- `wa-task-completion-ia-asylum.dmn`
- `wa-task-configuration-ia-asylum.dmn`
- `wa-task-initiation-ia-asylum.dmn`
- `wa-task-permissions-ia-asylum.dmn`
- `wa-task-types-ia-asylum.dmn`

**Output Example**:
```

```

## Known Limitations and Challenges

### Development Constraints
- **DMN file conflicts**: Cannot merge parallel changes due to unique ID regeneration
- **Limited UI customization**: Filters and columns are predefined in XUI
- **Testing complexity**: Functional tests currently unreliable

### Technical Challenges
- **Camunda modeler**: Regenerates unique IDs, complicating parallel development
- **Environment secrets**: Preview configuration sharing requires careful handling
- **Pipeline integration**: Not enabled due to work allocation team concerns

## Current Implementation Examples

### Detained Appeals
- Adding "Detained" prefix to existing task types
- Requires rule duplication for detained vs non-detained cases
- Significant configuration effort due to system limitations
- Alternative solutions (case category prefix) rejected by service requirements

## Best Practices

### Rule Configuration
- Use `processCategory` for logical task grouping and bulk cancellations
- Implement shortcuts for direct navigation to related UI events
- Configure appropriate delays for follow-up tasks
- Ensure publish flags are correctly set in CCD definitions

### Development Process
- Test changes in preview environment before deployment
- Maintain unit test coverage for all DMN rules
- Coordinate with team to avoid file merge conflicts
- Document rule logic and business requirements

## Support and Maintenance

### Monitoring
- **Camunda Cockpit**: Available for monitoring task execution and troubleshooting
- **Message Queue**: Monitor CCD event processing and task creation

### Troubleshooting
- Check publish flags in CCD configuration
- Verify DMN rule conditions and outputs
- Review Camunda logs for execution errors
- Validate case data availability for rule evaluation

## Getting Started

For new developers working with the Work Allocation system:

1. **Familiarize yourself** with DMN notation and Camunda concepts
2. **Set up preview environment** access for testing
3. **Review existing DMN files** to understand current rule patterns
