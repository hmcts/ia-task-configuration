# ia-task-configuration

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hmcts/spring-boot-template.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hmcts/spring-boot-template)

## Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to hold all IA related Camunda DMN's.

## What's inside

The repo contains:
 * IA DMN's
 * DMN's tests 

## Setup

Located in `./bin/init.sh`. Simply run and follow the explanation how to execute it.

## Notes

Since Spring Boot 2.1 bean overriding is disabled. If you want to enable it you will need to set `spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding` to `true`.

JUnit 5 is now enabled by default in the project. Please refrain from using JUnit4 and use the next generation

## Building and deploying the application

### Building the application

The project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org) as a build tool. It already contains
`./gradlew` wrapper script, so there's no need to install gradle.

To build the project execute the following command:

```bash
  ./gradlew build
```

### Running the application

Create the image of the application by executing the following command:

```bash
  ./gradlew assemble
```

Create docker image:

```bash
  docker-compose build
```

Run the distribution (created in `build/install/spring-boot-template` directory)
by executing the following command:

```bash
  docker-compose up
```

This will start the API container exposing the application's port
(set to `4550` in this template app).

In order to test if the application is up, you can call its health endpoint:

```bash
  curl http://localhost:4550/health
```

You should get a response similar to this:

```
  {"status":"UP","diskSpace":{"status":"UP","total":249644974080,"free":137188298752,"threshold":10485760}}
```

### Alternative script to run application

To skip all the setting up and building, just execute the following command:

```bash
./bin/run-in-docker.sh
```

For more information:

```bash
./bin/run-in-docker.sh -h
```

Script includes bare minimum environment variables necessary to start api instance. Whenever any variable is changed or any other script regarding docker image/container build, the suggested way to ensure all is cleaned up properly is by this command:

```bash
docker-compose rm
```

It clears stopped containers correctly. Might consider removing clutter of images too, especially the ones fiddled with:

```bash
docker images

docker image rm <image-id>
```

There is no need to remove postgres and java or similar core images.

## Hystrix

[Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki) is a library that helps you control the interactions
between your application and other services by adding latency tolerance and fault tolerance logic. It does this
by isolating points of access between the services, stopping cascading failures across them,
and providing fallback options. We recommend you to use Hystrix in your application if it calls any services.

### Hystrix circuit breaker

This template API has [Hystrix Circuit Breaker](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/How-it-Works#circuit-breaker)
already enabled. It monitors and manages all the`@HystrixCommand` or `HystrixObservableCommand` annotated methods
inside `@Component` or `@Service` annotated classes.

### Other

Hystrix offers much more than Circuit Breaker pattern implementation or command monitoring.
Here are some other functionalities it provides:
 * [Separate, per-dependency thread pools](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/How-it-Works#isolation)
 * [Semaphores](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/How-it-Works#semaphores), which you can use to limit
 the number of concurrent calls to any given dependency
 * [Request caching](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/How-it-Works#request-caching), allowing
 different code paths to execute Hystrix Commands without worrying about duplicating work
